# DestinyWwiseParserScript
Python file to create and parse .json files created by [WwiseParser](https://github.com/xyx0826/WwiseParser), semi specialized for Destiny and Destiny 2

## Usage
`parse.py <path to .bnk file>`
If you are using a file in the bnk directory, either use the full path, or open parse.py in notepad and change the "bnk_directory" path to use just the name.

## Planned Features
- Connectivity with [DestinyUnpacker](https://github.com/nblockbuster/DestinyUnpackerCPP) to get the bnk without having to extract the entire package.
- GUI
- Support for MusicCue types (unsure how they work for now)
